# Payment system

### Thoughts

- A lot to cover.
- Autofixture is maybe to much for this one.
- Test covarage could be much better but i think i proven what im can do. (Like the projections... )
- didn't spend time on databases but this architecture fits most databases. Mongo, MSSQl, Postgress and event azure table storage.
- not sure what the test looking for. but it's a very "all-around" test
- I'm used to azure Devops and would have triggers on commits for automated build test and deploy to dev environment.

### Runnig the application
